Help me generate 30 questions, each containing a word or phrase,
along with 4 options where one option is the synonym of the word or phrase. 
The question should be a single word or phrase,
and the words/phrases should focus on the essential vocabulary from the TOEFL test
Format the output in the following structure:
[
    {"question": "", "options": [], "answer": ""},
    {"question": "", "options": [], "answer": ""},
    {"question": "", "options": [], "answer": ""},
    {"question": "", "options": [], "answer": ""},
    {"question": "", "options": [], "answer": ""}
]
Answers should be represented by 0, 1, 2, or 3 and uniformly distributed.
