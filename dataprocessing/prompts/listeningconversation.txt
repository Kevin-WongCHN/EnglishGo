Generate a TOEFL-level listening conversation, followed by 3 questions, each with 4 answer options.
 Provide the correct answer for each question, along with explanations. 
 Format the response as JSON in the following structure:
 {
    "material": ["first speaker's text", "second speaker's text", "first speaker's text", ...],
    "questions": [],
    "options": [[]],
    "answers": [],
    "explanations": []
}
In the material, arabic numeral should not be included, use english words instead.
Answers should be represented by 0, 1, 2, or 3 and should be uniformly distributed.
No need to include phrases like "A said" or "B said," and avoid using option labels (A, B, C, D). Just provide the plain text of the conversation.
